# Die Game, coded by Yohanes Kifle
In this code I created a dice game!

How to play:

1. Enter the number of players
2. Enter each player name
3. The program will give a random roll of 3 die in this format [1,2,3]
4. This program keeps track of each players score (the sum of the 3 die)
5. The objective of this game is to get the highest score without TUPLING OUT ( Getting 3 duplicate numbers)
6. If you get a pair of duplicate rolls be careful, if you choose to roll again and get a third matching roll you will TUPLE OUT!
7. The game goes on until there is one winner left!
8. Have fun!
